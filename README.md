Book-Search-App




## Description who/what/why/when/how
This book app is a refactored Google book api using MERN. 


Going into this project felt like it'd be an easy project, but getting into the in's and out's of Apollo and GQL. After getting most of the back-end setup

it seemed like it would have ran smoothly, but I soon found out a lot of the knowledge I had for implementing my resolvers and typedefs based on the models was fairly limited in terms of my knowledge of MySQL, it took quite a bit of debugging on the front and back end as well as some help, and a lot of reading from the Apollo docs. Looking at it now as a working app, I can still see multiple areas where my code could use improvement.  I feel like this is one of the projects that taught me the most, and has made diving into other Apollo applications a lot smoother!
